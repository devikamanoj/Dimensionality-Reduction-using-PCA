# Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

## 19MAT117 - MATHEMATICS FOR INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS-2: PROJECT

## AIM ðŸŽ¯:

Reduce the size of the input image and produce all the possible images in the size-range given using different values of Principal Components(PCs)

## DATASET :

Images of different extensions were collected by the group members and stored in the link below.

## Evaluation Metrics: 
- Compression Ratio
- PSNR using MSE

## Working:
User is asked to input relative path to the image file, the folder the output images should be saved and the preferred size range of the output images. All the images with the size falling in the range are saved and their metrics like, compression ratio, size after compression, MSE, PSNR and number of PCs are displayed at the command window
